- find hierarchical data set
- check orientation with better data set
- pick best radius formula
- replace dist_euclid with dist_euclid_square where possible
- rename lambda/tau_1/tau_2? or learn_rate->alpha?
- faster neighborhood? put back bubble neighborhood?
- randomize choice of bmu/most distant neighbor/error node when multiple found?
- simplify insertion code
- cleaner memory management of list and data_vector
- write_to_img crashes if network is too deep for img resolution
- comment code
- limit usage of node_ids
